\chapter{Proposed approach}

\subsection{Overview}

The approach proposed in this chapter have been developed to correct some drawbacks and mainly to achieve an improved accuracy over the two approaches presented in Chapter 1. 

The two methods are now being used in synergy with each other, going to analyze each image at the same time looking for potential signs of forgery.

Starting from an image we want to analyze, the method will output a set of results.
\begin{itemize}
\item A classification \textbf{label} indicating whether an image is believed to be original or counterfeit.
\item A classification \textbf{score} indicating the confidence of the method output.
\item A \textbf{detection map} highlighting the detected spliced regions.
\end{itemize}

The proposed approach minimizes human interaction being fully automated. However, not both the modules can operate in any circumstance. The face splicing detection module will work only if there is a number of faces greater than or equal to two.
