\subsection{DSO-1}

The DSO-1 dataset is composed of 200 indoor and outdoor images with image resolution of 2048 Ã— 1536 pixels. Out of this set of images, 100 are original, i. e., have no adjustments whatsoever, and 100 are forged. The forgeries were created by adding one or more individuals in a source image that already contained one or more people. When necessary, we complemented an image splicing operation with post-processing operations (such as color and brightness adjustments) in order to increase photorealism.
